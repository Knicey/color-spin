example_code.cpp and test.cpp are both mid-development versions of ColorSpin.cpp
These two files are NOT FUNCTIONAL for their intended purpose.
ColorSpin.cpp is the algorithim that returns the rotation value required to change the current wheel color to the target wheel color.
It uses inputs from the camera and the FMS to determine which rotation value to give.
